The goal of reducing carbon emissions Borough-wide was quietly dropped and replaced by the far smaller goal of reducing emissions from council-owned buildings. Thus, any sale of council buildings would flatter their figures. The council claims that they will meet their goal—""40:20"" of several years ago—of achieving a 40% reduction in emissions by 2020.
