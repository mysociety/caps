    <h1 class="mb-4">About this project</h1>

    <p>This is the first public demo of a site that collects UK Council Climate Action Plans in a single database, alongside some data on area emissions estimates within the scope of influence of councils.</p>

    <p>Itâ€™s being developed by <a href="https://www.climateemergency.uk/">ClimateEmergency.uk</a> and <a href="https://www.mysociety.org">mySociety</a>, with input from a range of council climate officers, climate specialists, researchers, and journalists. We hope that it will soon allow anyone to quickly and easily find out if their council has a plan, and put those plans into context.</p>
