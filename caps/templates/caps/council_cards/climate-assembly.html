            [A citizensâ€™ assembly]({% url 'assembly_list' %}) brings together people from all walks of life to discuss an important issue.

            Local councils have been using climate assemblies to bring in perperpectives from their
            local communities to help shape their plans around climate change. 

            The report for the assembly held by {{ council.name }} can be found below.
