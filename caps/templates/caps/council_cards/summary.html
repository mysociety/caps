    Climate change is a global challenge, but reaching the UK's carbon emissions goals requires local action.
    
    Local councils, either through their services, or through their influence on residents and local businesses, have influence [over one-third of UK emissions](https://research.mysociety.org/html/joining-up/#what-does-local-government-do-and-what-is-its-role-in-tackling-climate-change-local-authorities-have-powers-and-influence-over-roughly-a-third-of-uk-emissions).

    [mySociety](https://mysociety.org) and [Climate Emergency UK](https://www.climateemergency.uk/) have created CAPE - to make councils' commitments, plans, and progress on climate action transparent and accessible to all.
    
    We are working to improve the quality of information that is available about local climate action, and about the levels of public support for climate action.
    
    By promoting information sharing and constructive scrutiny, we aim to drive more effective and coordinated action to reduce emissions.
    
    For {{ council.name }} we have collected the following information:
    {% for item in summary_menu_cards %}{% if not forloop.last %}{% if not forloop.first %}, {% endif %}{% else %} and {% endif %} <a href="#{{ item.slug }}">{{ item.title.lower }}</a>{% endfor %}.
