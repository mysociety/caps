                    <p>The Scorecards score each councilâ€™s Climate Action Plan on 28 questions across 9 sections, following <a href="https://www.climateemergency.uk/blog/climate-action-plan-checklist/">Climate Emergency UKâ€™s checklist</a></p>
                    <p>This scoring can only represent what has been captured within the councilsâ€™ public plans; not every action they have taken â€” although the published plans do tend to cover the majority of a councilâ€™s climate activity.</p>
                    <p>Donâ€™t forget to check out our <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IcqQFwcKcz0XcxKRu9h-g3Zj8TsbyhuI/view">â€˜Top 10 ways to Improve your Climate Action Planâ€™</a> summary document, which is written in response to some of the common themes we noticed in Council Climate Action Plans and how they could be improved.</p>
                    <p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IcqQFwcKcz0XcxKRu9h-g3Zj8TsbyhuI/view" class="d-inline-block btn btn-blue is--light my-4"><strong>Download:</strong> Top 10 policy document</a></p>
                    <p>Here are some helpful tips on how best to understand this data and use it for meaningful improvement to your councilâ€™s planned activity.</p>
                    <ul class="mb-4">
                        <li>Take time to <strong>understand the</strong> <a href="{% url 'scoring:methodology2022' %}">methodology</a> and what exactly the markers were looking for in each question. </li>
                        <li><strong>Look at each section score</strong>. You might have scored particularly well in some sections but not in others: why is that? Use the filter buttons to see which councils have scored highly in the sections that you didnâ€™t score as well on. What have these councils done differently with their plans, and what can you learn from this?</li>
                        <li><strong>Make use of the filter tools</strong>. Use the various criteria such as urbanisation, deprivation or population size to discover councils that are similar to yours, and see where the strengths and weaknesses are in their climate action plans.<br>
                        Or check your neighbouring councils: where have they scored well, and can you learn from them?<br>
                        These filters can help you understand more about what councils similar to you have done, and where you might be able to share learnings â€” or even budgets! 
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Remember that a low score might not indicate a lack of plans; it might be a result of weaker communication</strong>. Do you need to make sure that your plans are publicly available, from a page thatâ€™s easier to find on your website? Or is your council making progress that isnâ€™t captured in the plan?</li>
                        <li><strong>Share your successes</strong>. If you are a council that has scored well in a particular section, or overall, can you share your learnings and successes with other councils so that they can make progress faster and more easily?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>These Scorecards are publicly available online, so you may well find that residents, local campaign groups or other councillors ask about your councilâ€™s Climate Action Plan and Scorecard result.</p>
                    <p>We believe this is a real benefit of the project: for climate action to be effective, first, everyone needs to understand what is being done and why. Thatâ€™s the first step toward residentsâ€™ buy-in. Thereâ€™s a further advantage to having more people fully up to speed with the councilâ€™s plans:  as the net widens, youâ€™ll have access to more people with skills, experience, capacity or ideas worth sharing. </p>
                    <p>If you are interested in finding out more about your councilâ€™s score, including the evidence used for each score and analysis on how you could improve, please contact us. We are looking into providing further (for a fee) advice on how a council can improve their plan.</p>
