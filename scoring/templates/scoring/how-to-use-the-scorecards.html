                <p>Based on common themes we saw when assessing all UK councils we have written a short summary, <a href="">â€˜10 ways to improve your Councilâ€™s</a> climate actionâ€™. This covers 10 things that councils can do to improve their climate action based on our Scorecards.</p>
                <p>Once you've checked that out, you might be wondering what to do with this information. That's quite understandable â€” the path from data to action isn't always clear! So with that in mind we've gathered together some ways in which you, as residents and community groups, can use this data to bring about meaningful change.</p>

                <p><strong>Why?</strong> It helps show your council â€” and your followers â€”  that you care about the steps they say theyâ€™re taking towards net zero, and that there's support for strong action amongst their residents.</p>

                <p><strong>Why?</strong> The more exposure the Scorecards get, the more conversation there will be around councils taking strong climate action, bringing the idea into the mainstream.

                <h2 class="mt-5 mb-3">How to use the Scorecards as a Councillor or Officer</h2>
                <p>The Scorecards score each council's climate action on 91 questions across 7 sections, following <a href="{% url 'scoring:methodology' %}">Climate Emergency UKâ€™s methodology</a>. </p>
                <p>This scoring can only reflect information that was either already publicly available or released through a concise series of FOIs. Therefore the results are not reflective of every action the council has taken â€” although the questions cover a wide range of the council's climate activity. </p>
                <p>Donâ€™t forget to check out our â€˜10 ways to improve your Councilâ€™s climate actionâ€™ summary document, which is written in response to some of the common themes we noticed when marking council climate action and how they could be improved. </p>
                <p>Here are some helpful tips on how best to understand this data and use it for meaningful improvement to your council's planned activity.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Take time to <strong>understand the methodology</strong> and what exactly the markers were looking for in each question. </li>
                    <li><strong>Look at each section score</strong> You might have scored particularly well in some sections but not in others: why is that? Use the filter buttons to see which councils have scored highly in the sections that you didnâ€™t score as well on. What have these councils done differently, and what can you learn from this?</li>
                    <li><strong>Make use of the filter tools</strong> Use the various criteria such as urbanisation, deprivation or population size to discover councils that are similar to yours, and see where the strengths and weaknesses are in their climate action. Or check your neighbouring councils: where have they scored well, and can you learn from them? These filters can help you understand more about what councils similar to you have done, and where you might be able to share learnings â€” or even budgets! 
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Remember that a low score might not indicate a lack of action; it might be a result of weaker communication or national barriers.</strong> Is information on progress made by your council towards net zero publicly available and easy to access? </li>
                    <li><strong>Share your successes.</strong> If you are a council that has scored well in a particular section, or overall, can you share your learnings and successes with other councils so that they can make progress faster and more easily?</li>
                </ul>

                <p>These scorecards are publicly available online, so you may well find that residents, local campaign groups or other councillors ask about your council's climate action and scorecard result. </p>
                <p>We believe this is a real benefit brought by the project: for climate action to be effective, first, everyone needs to understand what is being done and why. That's the first step toward residents' buy-in. There's a further advantage to having more people fully up to speed with the council's progress towards achieving net zero: as the net widens, you'll have access to more people with skills, experience, capacity or ideas worth sharing. </p>
                <p>If you are interested in finding out more about your councilâ€™s score, including accessing the raw data used for each score and analysis on how you could improve, please contact us. We are looking into providing further (for a fee) advice on how a council can improve their climate action. </p>
