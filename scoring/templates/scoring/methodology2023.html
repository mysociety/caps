                        <p>We have now published the draft methodology for the Council Climate Action Scorecards. This lays out how we'll be marking and scoring all UK councils on the actions they're taking towards net zero. The Council Climate Action Scorecard results will be released in Autumn 2023.
                        </p>
                        <p>We will mark and score all UK councils on their climate action against 90 questions in 7 different sections. We created the criteria through extensive research and consultation with council staff, councillors, campaigners and other organisations. To understand what action we will be scoring and the question weightings, please read the complete draft methodology here. To find out more about how we created each section and why questions or topics were or were not included, check out our blog series on the draft methodology here.
                        </p>
                        <p>Whilst every effort has been made to make this methodology complete, <strong>Climate Emergency UK reserves the right to make changes to the methodology where deemed appropriate between now and Autumn 2023.</strong> Changes may be made, for example, if national policy changes between now and Autumn 2023 and this impacts our questions; or if the data needed to answer a particular question is no longer available to use. An updated methodology, identical to the one used in the marking, will be published, if needed, alongside the Council Climate Action Scorecards in Autumn 2023.

                            <p>In the following four tables you can see each of the questions that councils will be scored on in 2023, along with some further clarification of the question criteria. The table also shows how each question will be scored: whether from volunteer research, FOI responses from councils, the use of national data or through a mixture of volunteer research and national data. Unless otherwise stated, <strong>we are marking council climate action from 1st January 2019</strong> up until March 2023 (exact date to be confirmed). For questions that use national data we will take the most recent data up until 1st August 2023. For questions that use FOI requests, unless otherwise stated, we are marking council climate action from 1st January 2019 up until January 2023 when the FOI requests will be sent out. Strategies and Policies that we mark must also be in date and active (except for Local Plans where draft ones will be accepted).</p>
                            <p>Different council types have different powers. Therefore, questions are only being asked to a council where they have power or influence on that topic. For example, County Councils are not Planning Authorities so there are only two questions in the Planning section that apply to County Councils.

                        <p>This draft methodology does not show the exact number of points allocated for each question. These will be published alongside the results of the Council Climate Action Scorecards in Autumn 2023.</p>
                        <p>At this stage, you can see an indication as to which questions will be worth more points than others, shown as low, medium, or high importance. All of the actions that we are marking in our Scorecard questions are important: all of these actions will reduce greenhouse gas emissions and are actions that we want to see councils undertake, but within this, there are some actions that have a bigger and more direct impact on reducing emissions.</p>
                        <p>The questions that are weighted high are those which we consider to have the biggest impact on greenhouse gas emission reductions and a sustained long-term impact. For example, low emission policies implemented in Local Plans will have a huge impact on all new homes built over the next 10 years. Questions that are also key to enabling climate actions for councils are weighted high, such as whether they are finding finance for their climate actions or whether they have an annual Climate Action Plan Update.</p>
                        <p>Areas of action where the impact on greenhouse gas emissions is one step removed, or where the impact on emissions is reliant on other actors and actions, such as the national UK Government and devolved assemblies, are marked as medium.</p>
                        <p>For example, employing a retrofit officer is a really important action that councils can take, but this action alone wonâ€™t reduce greenhouse gas emissions from homes and buildings. Itâ€™s the work that this person will do, with other actors and funding that will lead to emission reductions. Another example is recycling; whilst councils can have a big role in improving recycling rates, it is also dependent on residentsâ€™ behaviour, national policy and how supermarkets package their food.</p>
                        <p>Questions that are weighted low include all actions which relate solely to the councils' own activities. These questions include: changing council processes to be more climate friendly; actions where councils have limited direct influence; and actions that are about the climate action strength of written strategies and plans. This is because council-only greenhouse gas emissions are a tiny part of an areaâ€™s overall emissions, between 2% and 7%. </p>
                        <p>These Scorecards focus on action, so whilst there is benefit in us scoring the strength of written plans, this too is weighted low. For the Planning section, we are scoring the strength of a councilsâ€™ Local Plan and for this section, questions measuring the strength of their written Local Plan have been given low, medium and high weightings. This is because we recognise that sustainability requirements in a Local Plan are a significant change in policy. </p>
                        <p>There are also some questions that will be scored negatively: councils will lose marks if they have taken actions that actively increase greenhouse gas emissions reduction. There are a total of three negatively scoring questions, found in the Transport, Governance & Finance and Planning sections.</p>

                            <h3 class="mb-2 mb-lg-3">Publicly available council information </h3>
                            <p>Unless stated otherwise in the question criteria, we will be scoring councils on any actions that they have taken since 1st January 2019 up until March 2023 (exact date to be confirmed soon). We chose this date because it was in 2019 that councils started declaring climate emergencies and we want to score councils on their action since this (renewed) commitment to climate action came into effect. </p>
                            <p>For example, if a council approved a solar panel farm in 2017 and no further renewable energy since then, the council would not get a point for the relevant question here. This is because councils need to be taking consistent climate action, so we would expect councils to be consistently pursuing actions such as this since 1st January 2019.</p>
                            <p>This does not entirely mean that councils' scores won't reflect action taken before 1st January 2019. For example, if a council worked hard to improve the EPC ratings of its council homes before 2019 through retrofitting and other insulation measures, then their average EPC ratings of these homes is likely to be higher, and they would therefore score higher for this particular question.</p>
                            <p>Whilst these Scorecards focus on council action, there are some questions that look at the details of particular policies. When we look at policies and strategies, they must be in date. For example if a Local Plan is dated 2015-2025, then this will be scored.</p>
                            <p>We will be looking for evidence that is publicly available. When we start marking in the new year, we will be looking at a wide variety of documents. Documents where this evidence might be available that we will consider when marking includes, but is not limited to:</p>

                                <p> A small number of councils will be changing structure and forming new council structures from 1st April 2023. Following consultations with the councils that this affects we have decided that, where this is the case, the new council will not be scored in the 2023 Scorecards. However, to ensure complete transparency we will include the new council names on the relevant Scorecard results lists, with a note that this council has not been scored this year.</p>
                                <p>In order to provide a complete as possible picture of council climate action in the UK from 2019 to 2023, we have decided to score councils that stop existing from 1st April 2023. Information about these old councils will only be visible through the new council name on our Scorecard site. These old councils wonâ€™t appear, or be scored against, other current councils. We recognise that not all evidence may be publicly available for old councils. However, we think it is important to score as much as we can, as some of this information will still be available, so that councils and campaigners in the new council structures can identify the best practice that previously existed in their area and adopt this best practice into the new council structures. </p>

                        <p>This is the first time a comprehensive list of actions that councils can and are taking to reduce greenhouse gas emissions has been created with the actions being scored. Therefore, extensive desk-based research was carried out to create this methodology. Hundreds of documents were read as part of this process. Some of the key documents that were the foundation for the research were:</p>

                            <p>Climate Emergency UK has spoken to over 90 different organisations in the creation of the Scorecards methodology. You can see the majority of organisations we spoke to in our Thank You section below.</p>
                            <p>We conducted 121 conversations and small group consultations on each section of the Scorecards. We also held two larger consultations, one with council staff and councillors, which almost 200 people attended, and another with campaign groups and external organisations that work with councils on climate action.</p>

                            <h3 class="mb-2 mb-lg-3">Trial Marking</h3>
                            <p>Staff conducted a trial mark on a select number of councils to test the draft questions. Following this, a volunteer trial mark was also carried out to further test the draft questions on a different, select number of councils.</p>
                            <p>A small number of Freedom of Information (FOI) requests were also sent out to a random selection of councils. This was important to learn how best to ask the FOI questions to create  the least amount of work for councils when responding and for us when collecting the data. The recipients were chosen at random in order to have a variety of council types in the trial. You can <a href="https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/user/climate_emergency_uk" class="d-inline-block">see all the trial FOI requests on WhatDoTheyKnow</a>. Please note that these are different to the final FOI requests included in the Scorecards methodology, and some trial FOI requests will not be  used this year.</p>

                            <h3 class="mb-3">Sections Summary</h3>

                            <h4 class="d-inline underline-green">Buildings & Heating</h4>
                            <p class="mt-2">Buildings and Heating is one of the biggest sectors of carbon and other greenhouse gas emissions in the UK. This section aims to cover the main actions that councils can take to support both private rented and owned homes and socially renting households to reduce the emissions from their homes.</p>
    
                            <h4 class="d-inline underline-green">Transport</h4>
                            <p class="mt-2">Transport is the other biggest sector of greenhouse gas emissions in the UK. This section covers the main enabling actions councils can take to reduce car use and encourage more sustainable transport within their area.</p>
    
                            <h4 class="d-inline underline-green">Governance & Finance</h4>
                            <p class="mt-2">This section aims to understand to what extent climate action has been incorporated and embedded across the whole of the council in all its activities and services in its decision making, forward planning and structures. This section also looks at how councils are raising funds for climate action and whether the councilsâ€™ investments are sustainable or supporting high carbon infrastructure and industries.</p>
    
                            <h4 class="d-inline underline-green">Planning</h4>
                            <p class="mt-2">This section focuses primarily on how councils are using their planning powers, primarily through their Local Plans, to ensure low emission new buildings and homes, as well as ensuring new developments are built to minimise their environmental impact. This section also covers the renewable energy generation and fossil fuel generation planning applications in the area.</p>
    
                            <h4 class="d-inline underline-green">Biodiversity</h4>
                            <p class="mt-2">The climate emergency is deeply connected to the ecological emergency. This section looks at what councils can do to protect and increase biodiversity in the area through their direct actions, the management of their green spaces, and biodiversity net gain requirements for developers. </p>
    
                            <h4 class="d-inline underline-green">Collaboration & Engagement</h4>
                            <p class="mt-2">This section addresses how councils can collaborate with others to improve their own climate action and to support others in the area to decarbonise. More than half of the emissions cuts needed to reach net zero rely on people and businesses taking up low-carbon solutions, and councils can work with those in their local area to enable those solutions.</p>
    
                            <h4 class="d-inline underline-green">Waste Reduction & Food</h4>
                            <p class="mt-2">This section looks at the influencing role councils can play in supporting sustainable food production on their land and in their schools, and circular economy initiatives locally. Councils also have an important role to play in waste and recycling locally and improving this. </p>
                        </div>

                        <div>
                            <h3 class="mb-3">Section Weightings</h3>
                            <p class="mt-2">Different sections have been weighted differently, and the reasons for this are explained below.</p>
                            <!-- TODO Should table go here? -->

                            <h4 class="d-inline underline-green">Transport and Buildings & Heating</h4>
                            <p class="mt-2">These are the areas where councils can have the biggest impact on area wide greenhouse gas emissions. It is also where single tier councils can take the most effective action to reduce emissions; therefore they have been given the highest weighting. County councils have more powers over transport than district councils, which is why this section is weighted higher for county councils and a lot lower for district councils. </p>

                            <h4 class="d-inline underline-green">Planning & Land Use and Governance & Finance</h4>
                            <p class="mt-2">These sections have a less direct impact on emissions reduction. However, they have a considerable impact on enabling climate action and embedding it in longer-term policies. All council types have similar power and responsibilities in Governance & Finance and the actions scored in this section demonstrate the councilâ€™s commitment to reducing emissions and embedding climate action across the council. Planning & Land Use is one of the areas where single tier and district councils can be the most effective and also hold a lot of power, both for mitigation and adaptation, hence the higher weighting here than for the final three sections. County councils are not planning authorities which explains their lower section weighting for the Planning & Land Use section. </p>

                            <h4 class="d-inline underline-green">Collaboration & Engagement, Biodiversity and Waste Reduction & Food</h4>
                            <p class="mt-2">For these sections all councils have the same section weightings. This is because, while still vital, the actions scored in these three sections have the lowest direct impact on emission reduction, and within them, all council types have similar powers in relation to what they can influence. It is also harder to assess the effective engagement and communication of a council, and typically councils that effectively engage their residents will have more buy-in and be able to be more ambitious, so they will be able to score more elsewhere. </p>
                            <p>All councils have less powers over food. For biodiversity, waste reduction and food, a significant amount of actions and emissions are outside of councilsâ€™ control, so a lower weighting has been given to these sections to reflect this. This is not a reflection of the wider importance of biodiversity, food and waste to address the climate emergency. </p>
                            <p>The powers that Northern Irish councils have are different to other nations. For example, Northern Irish councils have less control over Transport and Planning and Buildings which is why the weightings for Northern Ireland are different. </p>
