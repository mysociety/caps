                <span>This assessment marked Climate Action Plans that were 
                    publicly available on council websites on or before 20 September 
                    2021. As such, it is a snapshot of that moment in time: we acknowledge 
                    that some councils have published or updated plans since this date. 
                    The plans included in this assessment are listed on the individual 
                    council pages. Visit the <a href="https://data.climateemergency.uk/">Climate Action Plan Explorer</a> to see if there is a later version of a council’s plan.</span>

                    <p>In this pilot project we have only marked councils' 
                        Climate Action Plans. These Scorecards do not take into account
                         any action that councils may have underway. 
                    </p>
                    <p>In future years we plan to assess councils on the actual 
                        steps they are taking towards eliminating their climate 
                        emissions. However, this preparatory work is vital, as a 
                        strong plan is the first step towards taking robust climate 
                        action over a sustained period of time — and without a plan 
                        it is impossible for residents to participate in the democratic
                         process of holding their councils to account.

                    <p>To create the Council Climate Plan Scorecards we have 
                        marked UK councils' climate action plans, strategies and, 
                        if relevant, drafts of these documents. We have also marked 
                        other related plans and strategies if they are either mentioned in the
                         Climate Action Plan or linked to from the same webpage as the Climate Action Plan. 
                         Examples of these extra plans include separate Biodiversity Plans and emissions 
                         data documents. <strong>Plans must have been publicly available on the council’s website
                          on or before 20 September 2021 to be included.</strong>

                        created in partnership with Friends of the Earth, Centre for Alternative Technology, Ashden and APSE Energy, outlines the recommended contents of a strong Climate Action Plan.
                        The scoring system used in compiling the Scorecards was based on this checklist.

                <div style="max-width:550px">
                    <p>During the development of the scoring system, Climate Emergency UK held three consultations in which nearly 200 councillors, council officers, climate action campaigners and organisations were invited to comment on the process. In these sessions we delved into the details of the questions used to score against, explored how to make this process useful and manageable for councils and discussed the presentation of the data.</p>
                    <p>A survey on how the data should be presented was also sent to approx. 700 councillors and council officers who were not able to attend the events. This asked questions about how the data should be presented, for example:</p>
                    <ul class="mb-3">
                        <li>What do you think about us displaying a single overall score for each council?</li>
                        <li>Do you think it’s useful to display the breakdown of category scores?</li>
                        <li>What filters should be included?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Based on the feedback received from these sessions, the questions were refined to produce the final checklist. The right of reply was established as part of this process and it was decided that scores would be displayed by council type.</p>

                    <p>A team of around 120 trained volunteers marked all the Council Climate Action plans in the UK using the scoring system described above.</p>

                    <p>All councils in the UK were sent the scoring questions along with the first mark of their plan. They could see which questions had received points, but they couldn’t see individual scores for questions or their overall score. All councils, including those without a plan, were given a right of reply. Councils had three weeks to respond and highlight any mistakes in the first mark. Almost 50% of councils with a Climate Action Plan responded to the Right of Reply.</p>

                    <p>During the scoring audit a team of around 25 highly trained volunteers and CEUK staff reviewed the first mark alongside the council's right of reply. All plans were audited regardless of whether the council responded to the right of reply.</p>
