                <span>This assessment marked Climate Action Plans that were 
                    publicly available on council websites on or before 20 September 
                    2021. As such, it is a snapshot of that moment in time: we acknowledge 
                    that some councils have published or updated plans since this date. 
                    The plans included in this assessment are listed on the individual 
                    council pages. Visit the <a href="https://data.climateemergency.uk/">Climate Action Plan Explorer</a> to see if there is a later version of a council’s plan.</span>

                    <p>In this pilot project we have only marked councils' 
                        Climate Action Plans. These Scorecards do not take into account
                         any action that councils may have underway. 
                    </p>
                    <p>In future years we plan to assess councils on the actual 
                        steps they are taking towards eliminating their climate 
                        emissions. However, this preparatory work is vital, as a 
                        strong plan is the first step towards taking robust climate 
                        action over a sustained period of time — and without a plan 
                        it is impossible for residents to participate in the democratic
                         process of holding their councils to account.

                    <p>To create the Council Climate Plan Scorecards we have 
                        marked UK councils' climate action plans, strategies and, 
                        if relevant, drafts of these documents. We have also marked 
                        other related plans and strategies if they are either mentioned in the
                         Climate Action Plan or linked to from the same webpage as the Climate Action Plan. 
                         Examples of these extra plans include separate Biodiversity Plans and emissions 
                         data documents. <strong>Plans must have been publicly available on the council’s website
                          on or before 20 September 2021 to be included.</strong>

                        created in partnership with Friends of the Earth, Centre for Alternative Technology, Ashden and APSE Energy, outlines the recommended contents of a strong Climate Action Plan.
                        The scoring system used in compiling the Scorecards was based on this checklist.

                <div style="max-width:550px">
                    <p>During the development of the scoring system, Climate Emergency UK held three consultations in which nearly 200 councillors, council officers, climate action campaigners and organisations were invited to comment on the process. In these sessions we delved into the details of the questions used to score against, explored how to make this process useful and manageable for councils and discussed the presentation of the data.</p>
                    <p>A survey on how the data should be presented was also sent to approx. 700 councillors and council officers who were not able to attend the events. This asked questions about how the data should be presented, for example:</p>
                    <ul class="mb-3">
                        <li>What do you think about us displaying a single overall score for each council?</li>
                        <li>Do you think it’s useful to display the breakdown of category scores?</li>
                        <li>What filters should be included?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Based on the feedback received from these sessions, the questions were refined to produce the final checklist. The right of reply was established as part of this process and it was decided that scores would be displayed by council type.</p>

                    <p>All councils in the UK were sent the scoring questions along with the first mark of their plan. They could see which questions had received points, but they couldn’t see individual scores for questions or their overall score. All councils, including those without a plan, were given a right of reply. Councils had three weeks to respond and highlight any mistakes in the first mark. Almost 50% of councils with a Climate Action Plan responded to the Right of Reply.</p>

                <div style="max-width:550px">
                    <p>There are five ‘leagues’. Filters are ways of subdividing leagues further. Not all filters apply to all leagues (league too small, doesn’t make conceptual sense to divide), the same filter may have different groupings in different leagues (population bandings are different to reflect different population of different kinds of council)</p>
                    <p><strong>Data is in a private <a href="https://github.com/mysociety/climate_league_filter_datasets">repo</a></strong></p>

                    <h5>Index of multiple deprivation</h5>
                    <p>For two leagues (non-metropolitan districts, and single-tier), there is an index of multiple deprivation filters. This divides councils in each league into five quintiles, based on the multiple-deprivation ranking of a council in the group.</p>
                    <p>The county council leagues are split into two groupings of 12.</p>
                    <p>As the single-tier league contains different nations, this is based on <a href="https://github.com/mysociety/composite_uk_imd">mySociety’s composite UK index of multiple deprivation</a> for small areas. This is converted to a score for authority using <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/833947/IoD2019_Research_Report.pdf">the method in the English Index of Multiple Deprivation Research Report</a> (pg. 69).</p>

                    <h5>Index of multiple deprivation</h5>
                    <p>This filter uses data from <a href="http://opencouncildata.co.uk">Open Council Data UK</a> to get the current overall control for councils and allow plans to be compared within the same kind of political control. This is overall control as of Dec 2021, and may not reflect control when the plan was written.</p>

                    <h5>Population</h5>
                    <p>Local governments in the UK cover very different sizes of population. This filter groups councils into broad bands of populations. Different leagues have different bands because there are different distributions of population. This approach tries to create useful groupings of population size, so that councils are in general more similar to each other inside the group.</p>

                    <h5>Rural Urban Cluster</h5>
                    <p>Councils across the UK are grouped into four different groups: Urban, Urban with rural areas, Rural, as well as Sparse and Rural. These groupings have been made from a combination of <a href="https://github.com/mysociety/uk_ruc">rural/urban classifications</a> for small areas across England, Wales and Scotland.</p>

                    <h5>Region/Nation</h5>
                    <p>Region/Nation of the UK.</p>

                    <h5>Councils type</h5>
                    <p>Some leagues (single tier/combined authority) combine multiple types of local government. This filter lets you just look at a single type of local government.</p>

                    <p>The top performing councils in each scoring table have a star next to their name. In addition, this mark of recognition is displayed on the individual councils' pages, which also show if that council is a top performer within any of the categories.</p>

                <div style="max-width:550px">
                    <p>A number of counties throughout the UK have adopted a joined-up approach in addressing the climate crisis by producing a countywide plan for multiple levels of local government to follow.</p>
                    <p>For District Councils signed up to these county plans, we have marked both the District and the County plan. This means that for many questions, if the County Council has scored a mark, the District Council also gets the mark (even if it doesn't apply to their own plan). We have only done this for District Councils that have their own plans as it is not enough for them to simply sign up to a County Plan without doing their own planning.</p>
                    <p>However, for some questions (see below), the District plan had to have the information to get the mark and the County mark wasn't carried over. As a result, the scores of some districts are considerably higher than they would have been had we marked the District plan alone. We feel this is justified: a joined-up approach is best practice to tackle this universal issue collectively, and should be rewarded.</p>
                    <p>For all questions not listed, if the County plan received the mark, the District plan also received the mark. 
                        For the questions listed below, the evidence had to be included in the District plan to get the mark.</p>

                    <p>The term ‘anchor institutions’ is used to refer to organisations which:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Have an important presence in a place, usually through a combination of: being largescale employers, or the largest purchasers of goods and services in the locality; controlling large areas of land and/or having relatively ﬁxed assets.</li>
                        <li>Are tied to a particular place by their mission, histories, physical assets and local relationships. Examples include local authorities, NHS trusts, universities, trade unions, large local businesses, the combined activities of the community and voluntary sector and housing associations.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4 class="mb-3">Baseline emissions inventory</h4>
                    <p>Quantifies the amount of CO2 emitted due to energy consumption in the territory of the Council in the baseline year, e.g. how much CO2 was emitted in 2005?</p>
                </div>

                <div class="glossary-content-item">
                    <h4 class="mb-3">Capex</h4>
                    <p>The money an organisation or corporate entity spends to buy, maintain, or improve its fixed assets, such as buildings, vehicles, equipment, or land.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="glossary-content-item">
                    <h4 class="mb-3">Carbon budgets</h4>
                    <p>A carbon budget is the cumulative amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions permitted over a period of time to keep within a certain temperature threshold. Each Local Authority has an allocated carbon dioxide budget for the years up to 2100 in order to stay on track with the Paris agreement.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="glossary-content-item">
                    <h4 class="mb-3">Carbon negative</h4>
                    <p>Going carbon negative refers to carbon dioxide removal from the atmosphere after the council has achieved zero carbon. This means that not only are they no longer emitting carbon, but they are also actively removing carbon from the atmosphere as well.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="glossary-content-item">
                    <h4 class="mb-3">Carbon Neutral</h4>
                    <p>Carbon neutrality means balancing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by ‘offsetting’ – or removing from the atmosphere – an equivalent amount of carbon for the amount produced. This can be achieved by buying ‘carbon credits’ – in essence, permission to emit carbon dioxide or other GHG in exchange for offsetting the effects of those emissions – and/or by supporting GHG-reduction initiatives such as renewable-energy projects. However, a commitment to carbon neutrality does not require (or even necessarily imply) a commitment to reduce overall GHG emissions. A carbon-neutral business needs only to offset the GHG emissions it produces – even if those emissions are increasing.</p>

                <div class="glossary-content-item">
                    <h4 class="mb-3">Carbon Offsetting</h4>
                    <p>A carbon offset is a reduction in emissions of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases made in order to compensate for emissions made elsewhere. For example this could be by planting trees to suck carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere.</p>

                    <p>Net-zero means that the amount of greenhouse gases emitted will equal the amount which is taken out of the atmosphere by carbon offsetting. This is different from Zero Carbon which means the authority would be emitting no carbon at all. The net-zero target is the date which is set for when the organisation/area/country aims to reach net-zero. A good net-zero target will be very clear about what is covered in the target, e.g. whether it is the council's own operations or the whole area that will be net-zero, which gases are covered etc.</p>

                    <p>The Tyndall Centre is a partnership of universities bringing together researchers from the social and natural sciences and engineering to develop sustainable responses to climate change. It works with leaders from the public and private sectors to promote informed decisions on mitigating and adapting to climate change. For each council in the UK the Tyndall Centre has created a tool to allow local authorities to calculate their carbon budgets between now and the year 2100 to cut their emissions in line with climate science and the UN Paris Agreement. The tool shows the council how much they must reduce their carbon emissions every year in order to reach this goal.
