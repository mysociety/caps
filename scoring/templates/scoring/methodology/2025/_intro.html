                    <h2 id="section-summary" class="mb-3">Summary</h2>

                    <p>We have now published the draft methodology for the 2025 Council Climate Action Scorecards. This lays out how we'll be marking and scoring all UK councils for a second time on the actions they're taking towards net zero. The second edition of Council Climate Action Scorecard results will be released in Summer 2025.</p>

                    <p>We will mark and score all UK councils on their climate action against 93 questions in 7 different sections. The majority of changes to this methodology have been to clarify questions more clearly. You can find out more about what specific changes we have made and why in our <a href="https://climateemergency.uk/blog/how-council-climate-action-will-be-scored-in-2025/">Methodology 2025 blog here</a>. To find out more about how we created the complete methodology in 2022 and why questions or topics were or were not included in the overall methodology, <a href="https://www.climateemergency.uk/draft-methodology-blog-series/">check out our blog series on the methodology here</a>.</p>
                    
                    <p>There are four entirely new questions in the methodology (in Buildings &amp; Heating, Biodiversity, Collaboration &amp; Engagement and Transport (for Transport the new question is only for combined authorities) as well as one question in Governance &amp; Finance on procurement where Question 6 from 2023, with a three tier criteria, has been split out for 2025 into 6a (one tier criteria) and 6b (two tier criteria).</p>
                    
                    <p>The four new questions are:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                      <li>Transport (for combined authorities only) Q4c: Is the combined authority transitioning the bus fleet in their area to be zero-emission?</li>
                      <li>Buildings &amp; Heating 1b: Does the council have a target to retrofit all significant council buildings (excluding homes) and has this been costed?</li>
                      <li>Biodiversity Q10: Has the council introduced a Green Space Factor to increase habitat in new developments?</li>
                      <li>Collaboration &amp; Engagement Q12: Does the council have an ongoing way for employee representative bodies (including recognised trade unions) to influence the development and delivery of the council's Climate Action Plan?</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>The one question that has been removed was Question 1a "Has the council reduced single use plastic in its buildings and events?" in Waste Reduction &amp; Food, due to changes in UK law making it a legal requirement to ban the use and sale of some single use plastic.</p>
                    
                    <p>We created this updated criteria through extensive research and consultation with council staff, councillors, campaigners and other organisations. To understand what action we will be scoring and the question weightings, please read the complete draft methodology below.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Whilst every effort has been made to make this methodology complete, Climate Emergency UK reserves the right to make changes to the methodology where deemed appropriate between now and Summer 2025.</strong> Changes may be made, for example, if national policy changes between now and Summer 2025 and this impacts our questions; or if the data needed to answer a particular question is no longer available to use. An updated methodology, if there are any changes, identical to the one used in the marking, will be published, alongside the Council Climate Action Scorecards in Summer 2025.</p>
                    
                    <p>The Council Climate Action Scorecards is a project of Climate Emergency UK, in partnership with mySociety.</p>

                    <h2 id="section-methodology-review" class="mt-5 mt-lg-6 mt-xl-7 mb-3">Methodology Review</h2>

                    <p>Following the publication of the 2023 Council Climate Action Scorecards in October 2023, we have conducted a detailed review of the Action Scorecards methodology. We conducted this review in order to improve and clarify the questions, thereby ensuring the Action Scorecards are relevant, accurate and useful for residents and councils. This review happened between January and May 2024. Climate Emergency UK reviewed the questions and reflected on feedback from the sector, councils and campaigners on the 2023 Scorecards methodology. We then invited 15 randomly selected councils, alongside sector organisations, experts, campaigners and Scorecards volunteers to an online roundtable for each section, where changes were suggested and reviewed. All invitees were also sent a short feedback form to provide comment on the suggested changes.</p>

                    <p>Following the roundtables the suggested changes to the methodology, including any new questions, criteria changes or clarifications were reviewed in detail by the 2024/25 Advisory Group. 
                    </p>

                    <h2 id="section-question-criteria" class="mt-5 mt-lg-6 mt-xl-7 mb-3">Question Criteria</h2>

                    <p>Below you can see each of the questions that councils will be scored on in 2024/25, along with some further clarification of the question criteria. We’ve also shown how each question will be scored: whether from volunteer research, FOI responses from councils, the use of national data or through a mixture of volunteer research and national data.</p>

                    <h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">Date range of evidence</h3>
                    <p>Most questions marked by volunteers ask for evidence of climate action <strong>from 1st January 2020 up until October 2024</strong>. This is a similar date range we had to look for evidence for the 2023 Action Scorecards. The main difference is the change in date for evidence. This time around we are looking from the 1st January 2020, rather than looking for evidence from 1st January 2019 to March 2023. Strategies and policies that we mark must also be in date and active (except for Local Plans where Reg 19 drafts are accepted).
                    </p>

                    <p>Some questions ask about the current situation of a council, and therefore the date of the work is cumulative or not time specific. For example, we mark councils on how many school streets they currently have, at the time of the first mark. Therefore, it doesn’t matter if the first school streets were introduced in 2010, 2017 or 2023, as long as they are currently all in use. </p>

                    <p>Some questions ask about evidence within a particular date range. For example, we mark councils on whether they have produced an annual Climate Action Plan Update since 1st January 2023 (note the update date for the 2025 methodology). This is a specific date range as this is needed to ensure that councils are publishing annual updates regularly, rather than one annual update in 2022 and nothing since.</p>
                    <p>For questions that use national data we will take the most recent data up until Spring 2025. And for questions that use FOI requests, unless otherwise stated in the  FOIs, we are marking council climate action from 1st January 2020 up until early 2025. 
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">Different questions for different council types</h3>

                    <p>Different council types have different powers. Therefore, questions are only asked to a council where they have power or influence on that topic. For example, county councils are not Planning Authorities so there are only two questions in the Planning section that apply to county councils. To understand more about the different powers that different councils have, <a href="https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/explainers/local-government">check out this blog from the Institute for Government</a>. <strong>This is why, sometimes, you will see, for example, questions 1, 2, and 4 but not question 3, as question 3 doesn't apply to the council you have selected.</strong></p>

                    <p>There are a few questions in the Scorecards that apply to some councils but not others, depending on their powers or local situation. As almost a third of district and single tier authorities do not directly own or manage their own housing so the questions relating to council owned homes (in Buildings &amp; Heating and Planning &amp; Land Use) do not apply to these councils. These questions only apply to councils that, via FOIs, tell us if they directly manage any council homes and how many.</p>

                    <p>In Transport, if a council <strong>does not receive penalty marks</strong> in Transport Q12a (where penalty marks are awarded if a council has a significant proportion of neighbourhoods above the WHO NO2 guidelines), then questions 5a and 5b, which ask if councils have implemented clean air zones, will not apply to them. This change primarily affects those councils which are more rural and would be unlikely to implement a clean air zone as their air quality is less likely to be above WHO guidelines.</p>

                    <h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">Combined Authorities</h3>
                    <p>Combined authorities have quite different powers and responsibilities to other council structures. This is why there are fewer sections and questions for combined authorities. Of all the questions for combined authorities, just under half of these questions are the same as for other council types. The remaining questions are only applicable to combined authorities, of which some of these questions are similar to questions being asked of other council types. You can read our <a href="https://www.climateemergency.uk/draft-methodology-blog-series/">blog listed here</a> for further information on how combined authority powers differ to other council types and why we created the combined authority methodology the way we did.</p>
