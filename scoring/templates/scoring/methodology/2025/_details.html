                    <h2 id="section-question-weighting-within" class="mt-5 mt-lg-6 mt-xl-7 mb-3">Question weighting within sections</h2>

                    <p>Question weighting within sections has remained the same from the 2023 Action Scorecards for the 2025 Action Scorecards for all questions except five of them. <strong>The five questions which have changed in weighting are:</strong></p>

                    <ul>
                    <li><strong>Transport Q6</strong>: Has the council taken clear steps to support active travel? Has changed from a high to medium weighting</li>
                    <li><strong>Transport Q9</strong>: Does the council have a workplace parking levy? Has changed from a high to medium weighting</li>
                    <li><strong>Buildings &amp; Heating Q5</strong>: Is the council part of a programme or partnership to support home retrofitting, through providing the skills and training needed or in other ways? Has changed from a medium to low weighting</li>
                    <li><strong>Waste Reduction &amp; Food Q8</strong>: How high is the councils' area wide annual recycling rate? Has changed from a medium to low weighting</li>
                    <li><strong>Waste Reduction &amp; Food Q9</strong>: How low is the councils' area wide level of household waste produced? Has changed from a low to medium weighting</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>The question weighting determines the importance of that question to the overall section score. All questions in the Action Scorecards are out of a number of marks, ranging from 1 to 6, as well as some questions where penalty points are awarded and councils lose marks (more on penalty marks below). This is the raw mark for each question.</p>

                    <p>To ensure appropriate weighting to each question, each raw score for a question has been translated into a score out of one, two or three, depending on whether the question is weighted low (one), medium (two) or high (three). We have converted each raw mark into the equivalent fraction out of one, two or three. For example, if a question is out of 4 raw marks and the question is weighted as high, then if a council scores 2 out of 4, their weighted score would be 1.5 out of 3. If a council had scored 1 out of 4, their weighted score would be 0.75 out of 3. More on how we calculated the final scores here.</p>

                    <p>All questions in the Action Scorecards are weighted low, medium or high (except the penalty mark questions and question 2 in Transport, which receives one point for every option).</p>

                    <h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">Why do you have question weighting?</h3>

                    <p>All of the actions that we are marking in our Scorecard questions are important: all of these actions will reduce greenhouse gas emissions and are actions that we want to see councils undertake, but within this, there are some actions that have a bigger and more direct impact on reducing emissions.</p>

                    <p>The questions that are weighted high are those which we consider to have the biggest impact on greenhouse gas emission reductions and a sustained long-term impact. For example, low emission policies implemented in Local Plans will have a huge impact on all new homes built over the next 10 years. Questions that are also key to enabling climate actions for councils are weighted high, such as whether they are finding finance for their climate actions or whether they have an annual Climate Action Plan Update.</p>
                    
                    <p>Areas of action where the impact on greenhouse gas emissions is one step removed, or where the impact on emissions is reliant on other actors and actions, such as the national UK Government and devolved assemblies, are marked as medium.</p>
                    
                    <p>For example, employing a retrofit officer is a really important action that councils can take, but this action alone won't reduce greenhouse gas emissions from homes and buildings. It's the work that this person will do, with other actors and funding that will lead to emission reductions. Another example is recycling; whilst councils can have a big role in improving recycling rates, it is also dependent on residents' behaviour, national policy and how supermarkets package their food.</p>
                    
                    <p>Questions that are weighted low include all actions which relate solely to the councils' own activities. These questions include: changing council processes to be more climate friendly; actions where councils have limited direct influence; and actions that are about the climate action strength of written strategies and plans. This is because council-only greenhouse gas emissions are a tiny part of an area's overall emissions, between 2% and 7%.</p>
                    
                    <p>These Scorecards focus on action, so whilst there is benefit in us scoring the strength of written plans, this too is weighted low. For the Planning section, we are scoring the strength of a councils' Local Plan and for this section, questions measuring the strength of their written Local Plan have been given low, medium and high weightings. This is because we recognise that sustainability requirements in a Local Plan are a significant change in policy.</p>

                    <h3 id="penalty-marks" class="mt-5 mb-3">Penalty Marks</h3>

                    <p class="alert alert-primary">Penalty marks have remained exactly the same from the 2023 Action Scorecards for the 2025 Action Scorecards except for a small change with question 12a in the Transport section.</p>

                    <p>If a council <strong>does not receive penalty marks</strong> for this question (Transport Q12a), where penalty marks are awarded if a council has a significant proportion of neighbourhoods above the WHO NO2 guidelines, then Transport questions 5a and 5b, which ask if councils have implemented clean air zones, <strong>do not</strong> apply to them. This change primarily affects those councils which are more rural and would be unlikely to implement a clean air zone as their air quality is less likely to be above WHO guidelines.</p>
                    
                    <p>There are four questions where councils can receive penalty marks and they lose marks. These are questions where the action that a council has taken is contributing to higher carbon emissions. Where a council has been awarded the penalty mark, the penalty mark is a percentage reduction of the maximum possible score for this section. This is how all penalty marks are calculated for all councils types and all penalty mark questions, except for county councils for Question 11 in Planning and Land Use. For this question, the penalty marks for county councils is up to 4.5 points (equivalent to the penalty mark percentage deduction for single-tier authorities) to be taken off their total section score. This has been done this way because the maximum number of raw marks county councils can be awarded in this section is 3 and approving fossil fuel infrastructure, such as new oil drilling or a coal mine has a major effect on increasing emissions.</p>
                    
                    <p>These penalty marks only apply in three sections: Transport, Governance &amp; Finance and Planning and Land Use. Not all of the penalty mark questions apply to all council types, due to the difference in council powers.</p>
                    
                    <p>You can see below which questions carry penalty marks, which council types these questions apply to and the penalty mark awarded.</p>

                    <p>Transport is the other biggest sector of greenhouse gas emissions in the UK. This section covers the main enabling actions councils can take to reduce car use and encourage more sustainable transport within their area.</p>

                    <h4 class="mt-4 mb-2">Governance &amp; Finance</h4>

                    <p>This section aims to understand to what extent climate action has been incorporated and embedded across the whole of the council in all its activities and services in its decision making, forward planning and structures. This section also looks at how councils are raising funds for climate action and whether the councils' investments are sustainable or supporting high carbon infrastructure and industries.</p>

                    <h4 class="mt-4 mb-2">Planning and Land Use</h4>

                    <p>This section focuses primarily on how councils are using their planning powers, primarily through their Local Plans, to ensure low emission new buildings and homes, as well as ensuring new developments are built to minimise their environmental impact. This section also covers the renewable energy generation and fossil fuel generation planning applications in the area.</p>

                    <h4 class="mt-4 mb-2">Biodiversity</h4>

                    <p>The climate emergency is deeply connected to the ecological emergency. This section looks at what councils can do to protect and increase biodiversity in the area through their direct actions, the management of their green spaces, and biodiversity net gain requirements for developers.</p>

                    <h4 class="mt-4 mb-2">Collaboration &amp; Engagement</h4>

                    <p>This section addresses how councils can collaborate with others to improve their own climate action and to support others in the area to decarbonise. More than half of the emissions cuts needed to reach net zero rely on people and businesses taking up low-carbon solutions<sup>1</sup>, and councils can work with those in their local area to enable those solutions.</p>

                    <h4 class="mt-4 mb-2">Waste Reduction &amp; Food</h4>

                    <p>This section looks at the influencing role councils can play in supporting sustainable food production on their land and in their schools, and circular economy initiatives locally. Councils also have an important role to play in waste and recycling locally and improving this.</p>

                    <h4 class="mt-4 mb-2">Transport and Buildings &amp; Heating</h4>
                    <p>These are the areas where councils can have the biggest impact on area wide greenhouse gas emissions. It is also where single tier councils can take the most effective action to reduce emissions; therefore they have been given the highest weighting. County councils have more powers over transport than district councils, which is why this section is weighted higher for county councils and a lot lower for district councils. </p>

                    <h4 class="mt-4 mb-2">Planning &amp; Land Use and Governance &amp; Finance</h4>
                    <p>These sections have a less direct impact on emissions reduction. However, they have a considerable impact on enabling climate action and embedding it in longer-term policies. All council types have similar power and responsibilities in Governance &amp; Finance and the actions scored in this section demonstrate the council’s commitment to reducing emissions and embedding climate action across the council. Planning &amp; Land Use is one of the areas where single tier and district councils can be the most effective and also hold a lot of power, both for mitigation and adaptation, hence the higher weighting here than for the final three sections. County councils are not planning authorities which explains their lower section weighting for the Planning section. </p>

                    <h4 class="mt-4 mb-2">Collaboration &amp; Engagement, Biodiversity and Waste Reduction &amp; Food </h4>
                    <p>For these sections all councils have the same section weightings. This is because, while still vital, the actions scored in these three sections have the lowest direct impact on emission reduction, and within them, all council types have similar powers in relation to what they can influence. It is also harder to assess the effective engagement and communication of a council, and typically councils that effectively engage their residents will have more buy-in and be able to be more ambitious, so they will be able to score more elsewhere. </p>
                    <p>All councils have less powers over food. For biodiversity, waste reduction and food, a significant amount of actions and emissions are outside of councils’ control, so a lower weighting has been given to these sections to reflect this. This is not a reflection of the wider importance of biodiversity, food and waste to address the climate emergency. </p>
                    <p>The powers that Northern Irish councils have are different to other nations. For example, Northern Irish councils have less control over Transport, Planning &amp; Land Use and Buildings &amp; Heating, which is why the weightings for Northern Ireland are different.</p>
                    <p>The powers that combined authorities have are different to other council types. For example, combined authorities have almost no power or responsibility for Waste Reduction &amp; Food, other than Manchester Combined Authority which works with other councils in the area as a waste collection authority (and the Greater London Authority and theWest Midlands Combined Authority play a small role in waste regionally too). In other areas, Combined Authorities have more power, funding and influence, such as in adult education and green skills which is why these questions have been added to the Buildings &amp; Heating section, making it the Buildings, Heating and Green Skills section. Combined Authorities have less power over new and existing buildings and their carbon emissions in an area hence changing the Buildings &amp; Heating questions to include more on Green Skills. </p>

                    <h4 class="h3 mt-5 mb-2">Calculating the final score</h4>
                    <p>There are four stages to creating the final score.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Raw marks are converted into low, medium and high weighted marks.</li>
                        <li>Penalty marks are deducted where councils have received them.</li>
                        <li>Total weighted marks are added up and converted into an overall percentage score for each section.</li>
                        <li>The final score is created from adding up the overall section scores and applying the section weighting. For example, receiving a 50% score in Collaboration &amp; Engagement equals 5% of a council’s overall score. This is because Collaboration &amp; Engagement is worth 10% of a council's overall score. </li>
                    </ol>

                    <h2 id="section-what-we-marked" class="mt-5 mt-lg-6 mt-xl-7 mb-3">What We are Marking</h2>

                    <h3 class="mt-4 mb-3">Publicly available council information</h3>

                    <p>Unless stated otherwise in the question criteria, we will score councils on any actions that they have taken since 1st January 2020 up until October 2024. We chose this date because it was in 2019 that councils started declaring climate emergencies and we want to score councils on their action since this (renewed) commitment to climate action came into effect. </p>
                    <p>For example, if a council approved a solar panel farm in 2017 and no further renewable energy since then, the council would not get a point for the relevant question here. This is because councils need to be taking consistent climate action, so we expect councils to be consistently pursuing actions such as this since 1st January 2019.</p>
                    <p>This does not entirely mean that councils' scores do not reflect action taken before 1st January 2020. For example, if a council worked hard to improve the EPC ratings of its council homes before 2020 through retrofitting and other insulation measures, then their average EPC ratings of these homes is likely to be higher, and they would therefore score higher for this particular question.</p>
                    <p>Whilst these Scorecards focus on council action, there are some questions that look at the details of particular policies. When we look at policies and strategies, they must be in date. For example if a Local Plan is dated 2015-2025, then this is scored.
                    </p>
                    <p>We look for evidence that is publicly available across a wide variety of documents. Documents where this evidence might be available that we consider when marking includes, but is not limited to:</p>

                    <h3 class="mt-4 mb-2 mb-lg-3">National data</h3>

                    <p>For some of the questions, we use external data, compiled by the UK Government, the Devolved Nations or other national non-governmental organisations. We use this data for specific questions only and the use of this data is not an endorsement of the organisation or government body. Unless otherwise stated in the question criteria, we use the most recent national data available up until Spring 2025.

                    <h3 class="mt-4 mb-2 mb-lg-3">Freedom of Information Requests</h3>

                    <p>We will send FOI requests (technically sent as Environmental Information Regulations (EIR) requests) to all UK councils in late summer 2024 using <a href="https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/">WhatDoTheyKnow</a> (run by mySociety).  You can see the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1psO30U3LlqdJTVta9vqnm1U0qi8Jhtr8ua5aPhPIqDA/edit?usp=sharing">lists of FOI requests we will send here</a>.
                    </p>

                    <p>Any response provided via WhatDoTheyKnow from a council is valid. The same as last year, if a council responds to all FOI requests in one response, this is valid. If a council responds to an FOI with a link to a portal to sign up or create a password and view the response with a time limit, this response will not be used. This is because the underlying principles of FOI/EIR requests is to make information freely and easily available and responding with information behind passwords or a time limit is not freely available.</p>
                    <p>Volunteers are trained to read the FOI responses from councils and log the responses appropriately during the first mark and councils are able to see their own FOI responses during the Right of Reply.</p>
                    <p>Following the same as last year, if a council responds with information in the Right of Reply that is different to information we receive via WhatDoTheyKnow we will use the information provided in the Right of Reply to award marks for the relevant questions in the Scorecards. We also annotate the original FOIs with this updated information, which will be visible on the relevant FOIs onWhatDoTheyKnow when the FOIs responses are published.</p>
                    <p>FOI responses and responses from councils provided in the Right of Reply will be reviewed as part of the audit when awarding the final score. </p>

                    <h3 class="mt-4 mb-2 mb-lg-3">New or Councils that have changed structures</h3>

                    <p>As per last year, we will not be scoring new councils or combined authorities that are created in the year that we start marking. Three new or merged combined authorities have been created in 2024 and they will not be marked in the 2025 Action Scorecards. These following combined authorities that we are <strong>not</strong> marking in 2025 are: East Midlands Combined County Authority, York and North Yorkshire Combined Authority and North East Mayoral Combined Authority. </p>

                    <h2 id="section-developing-the-scoring-system" class="mt-5 mt-lg-6 mt-xl-7 mb-3">Developing the scoring system</h2>

                    <p>Extensive desk-based research was carried out to create the Council Climate Action Scorecards methodology in 2022, of which much has remained the same for the updated 2025 draft methodology. Hundreds of documents were read as part of this process. Some of the key documents that were the foundation for the research were:</p>

                        <li><a href="https://www.climateemergency.uk/blog/climate-action-plan-checklist/">The Climate Action Plan Checklist</a></li>

                    </ul>
                    <p class="mt-3 mt-lg-4">We also carried out extensive consultation and benefited from advice and feedback from a wide variety of people and organisations, through our Advisory Group, sector-specific consultations, one-to-one conversations and group consultations. </p>

                    <h3 class="mt-4 mb-2 mb-lg-3"><span>Advisory Group</span></h3>

                    <p>Since May 2022, Climate Emergency UK has had an Advisory Group to guide the creation of the Scorecard methodology. This Advisory Group includes council staff, councillors and experts within the sector who have been meeting monthly to provide detailed feedback on each question as they have been created.</p>

                    <p>Following the publication of the 2023 Council Climate Action Scorecards we have renewed the membership of the Advisory Group. The membership of the 2024/25 Advisory Group is as follows.</p>

                    <h4>Continuing members:</h4>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Jon Burke - Climate Change and Decarbonisation Lead, Gloucester City Council</li>
                      <li>Simon Jermy - Climate Emergency Manchester</li>
                      <li>Donna Stimson - Founder of Green Skills Library and former Climate Cabinet Lead for Royal Borough of Windsor &amp; Maidenhead</li>

                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="mt-4 mb-2 mb-lg-3">Consultations</h3>

                    <p>Climate Emergency UK has spoken to over 90 different organisations in the creation of the Scorecards methodology that was published in 2023 . You can see the majority of organisations we spoke to in our Thank You section below.</p>
                    <p>We conducted 121 conversations and small group consultations on each section of the Scorecards. We also held two larger consultations, one with council staff and councillors, which almost 200 people attended, and another with campaign groups and external organisations that work with councils on climate action.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="mt-4 mb-2 mb-lg-3">Trial marking</h3>

                    <p>We use trial marking and (trial FOIs where needed) to test new questions in the methodology. For 2025 all new questions will have been trial marked (and FOIs sent if needed) before being used in the methodology by volunteers. </p>
                    <p>To create the complete methodology in 2023 staff conducted a trial mark on a select number of councils to test the draft questions. Following this, a volunteer trial mark was also carried out to further test the draft questions on a different, select number of councils.</p>
                    <p>A small number of Freedom of Information (FOI) requests were also sent out to a random selection of councils in 2023. This was important to learn how best to ask the FOI questions to create  the least amount of work for councils when responding and for us when collecting the data. The recipients were chosen at random in order to have a variety of council types in the trial. Here you can <a href="https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/user/climate_emergency_uk">see all the trial FOI requests on WhatDoTheyKnow</a> that we sent in 2023. Please note that these are different to the final FOI requests included in the Scorecards methodology, and some trial FOI requests were not used in the 2023 Action Scorecards.

                    <p>All councils in the UK are sent their first mark for all questions marked by volunteer research and questions marked by FOI requests. Councils can see which questions had received marks, but they can’t see individual scores for questions or their overall score. All councils are given a right of reply. Councils have five weeks to respond.In 2023, 74% of all UK councils responded to the Right of Reply.</p>

                    <h3 class="mt-4">Scoring Audit</h3>
                    <p>During the scoring audit a team of around 50 highly trained volunteers and CE UK staff review the first mark alongside the council's right of reply. All plans are audited regardless of whether the council responds to the right of reply. National data is also inputted into the Scorecards to create the final score. </p>

                    <p>These Scorecards would not have been possible without the advice, comments and feedback from the many different organisations we spoke to, as well as our trial volunteer markers and most importantly our Scorecard volunteers assessors and auditors.</p>
                    <p>Special thanks to mySociety, who have provided technical support in the creation of the Scorecard methodology. We also want to thank the many councillors and council staff we spoke to, who represented all council types and work across the four nations. Thank you also to the more than 90 different organisations we spoke to for comment and advice on the original Scorecards creation throughout 2022, on specific questions, sections or general advice. The vast majority of the organisations we spoke to are listed here in alphabetical order.</p>
