                    <h2 id="section-summary" class="mb-3">Summary</h2>

                    <p>This is the methodology for the Council Climate Action Scorecards, which was published as a draft in November 2022 and a final version was published in October 2023. This lays out how we have marked and scored all UK councils on the actions they've taken towards net zero.</p>

                    <p>You can view this methodology <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1w8eE7FFvr80-Xdu8i2wNk382-ETFi48j/view">as a written PDF document here</a>. You can view the Scorecards questions, criteria and clarifications <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GYJMSvnnontf_TABFTGHZpUQDR9kqBepoYP8FhpmqOM/edit#gid=1597330053">in a spreadsheet format here</a> and the combined authority Scorecards questions, criteria and clarifications <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/184_YLzBZKZQHIQYVe1iJOcKrh2TB7s77W3IMhGJgueo/edit#gid=1860210559">in this spreadsheet</a>.</p>

                    <p>We have marked and scored all UK councils on their climate action against 91 questions or less, depending on council type, in 7 different sections. We created the criteria through extensive research and consultation with council staff, councillors, campaigners and other organisations. To understand what action we are scoring and the question weightings, please read below. To find out more about how we created each section and why questions or topics were or were not included, check out <a href="https://www.climateemergency.uk/draft-methodology-blog-series/">our blog series on the draft methodology here</a>.</p>

                    <p>The finalised methodology is what was used to assess councils in the 2023 Council Climate Action Scorecards. Compared to the draft methodology that was published in November 2022, there have been some minor changes. These changes include adding in two new questions to the transport section for single-tier and district councils, completing the criteria for a couple of questions and a handful of minor clarifications elsewhere.</p>

                    <p>The Council Climate Action Scorecards is a project of Climate Emergency UK, with technical support from <a href="https://www.mysociety.org/">mySociety</a>.</p>

                    <h2 id="section-question-criteria" class="mt-5 mb-3">Question criteria</h2>

                    <p>Below you can see each of the questions that councils have been scored on in 2023, along with some further clarification of the question criteria. We’ve also shown how each question will be scored: whether from volunteer research, FOI responses from councils, the use of national data or through a mixture of volunteer research and national data. <strong>Unless otherwise stated, we are marking council climate action from 1st January 2019 up until 31st March 2023</strong>. For questions that use national data we will take the most recent data up until 1st August 2023. For questions that use FOI requests, unless otherwise stated, we are marking council climate action from 1st January 2019 up until January 2023 when the FOI requests will be sent out. We have accepted FOI responses up until 31st July 2023. Strategies and Policies that we mark must also be in date and active (except for Local Plans where drafts have been accepted).</p>

                    <p>Different council types have different powers. Therefore, questions are only asked to a council where they have power or influence on that topic. For example, county councils are not Planning Authorities so there are only two questions in the Planning section that apply to county councils. To understand more about the different powers that different councils have, <a href="https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/explainers/local-government">check out this blog from the Institute for Government</a>. <strong>This is why, sometimes, you will see, for example, questions 1, 2, and 4 but not question 3, as question 3 doesn’t apply to the council you have selected</strong>.</p>

                    <h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">Combined Authorities</h3>
                    <p>This methodology is identical to the one used in the marking of the Council Climate Action Scorecards in Autumn 2023. Compared to the draft methodology that was published in February 2023 for combined authorities, there have been some minor changes, such as defining the criteria for questions 9a and 9b in Buildings, Heating and Green Skills and other minor clarifications.</p>
                    <p>Combined authorities have quite different powers and responsibilities to other council structures. This is why there are fewer sections and questions for combined authorities. Of all the questions for combined authorities, just under half of these questions are the same as for other council types. The remaining questions are only applicable to combined authorities, of which some of these questions are similar to questions being asked of other council types. <a href="https://www.climateemergency.uk/draft-methodology-blog-series/">You can read our blog listed here</a> for further information on how combined authority powers differ to other council types and why we created the combined authority methodology the way we did. </p>
