                <p>Climate Emergency UK was set up in response to the climate emergency declarations that councils started making from the end of 2018. CE UK began by collecting these declarations, and the Climate Action Plans that followed, on its website.</p>

                <p>CE UK worked with longstanding civic tech NGO <a href="https://www.mysociety.org/">mySociety</a> to create CAPE, the <a href="https://data.climateemergency.uk/">Climate Action Plan Explorer</a>. This took the plans collected by CE UK and placed them into a database, allowing users to easily locate and read their council’s Climate Action Plan, if it has one, and search across all councils' plans.</p>
                <p>At around the same time, CE UK created the <a href="https://www.climateemergency.uk/blog/climate-action-plan-checklist/">Climate Action Plan Checklist</a> with the support of Friends of the Earth, Ashden, the Centre for Alternative Technology and APSE Energy. This extensively researched document outlines the elements of a strong Climate Action Plan and highlights best practice from councils all over the world.</p>
                <p>While both of these tools are very useful, neither allow residents to understand the quality of their council’s Climate Action Plan, or how their council’s plan compares to others. Without this information it is difficult to know how their council can improve, and what to ask for. For this reason CE UK decided to assess Climate Action Plans and publish the findings publicly.</p>
                <p>This is a pilot project for CE UK, and the first time that this analysis has been undertaken. The work was carried out by our small staff team and our wonderful team of over 120 trained volunteers.</p>
                {% comment %} TODO missing link {% endcomment %}
                <p>TWe began by scoring the plans using the Checklist as a starting point. From there we identified which elements are essential components of a Climate Action Plan. We removed all questions relating to the action the council was taking on climate change, as we decided to focus only on the written plans in the first year of this project. To find out more read Developing the Scoring System.</p>

                <h4 class="mb-3">Why did we create the Scorecards?</h4>
                <p>According to the Climate Change Committee’s Local Authorities and the Sixth Carbon Budget Report, “More than half of the emissions cuts needed rely on people and businesses taking up low-carbon solutions – decisions that are made at a local and individual level. Many of these decisions depend on having supporting infrastructure and systems in place. Local authorities have powers or influence over roughly a third of emissions in their local areas.”</p>
                <p>At Climate Emergency UK we believe there is so much that local authorities can do to support the transition to net-zero. The first step in taking strong action is always to plan well, which is why it is vital that local authorities have robust Climate Action Plans. It is also important that residents know what their council is proposing to do to tackle the climate crisis. That’s why we’ve assessed all the Climate Action Plans of every local authority in the UK.</p>
                <p>These Council Climate Plan Scorecards will:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Allow residents and campaigners to understand the quality of their council’s Climate Action Plan according to our scorecards.</li>
                    <li>Help councils to see where they have done well and where they could improve.</li>
                    <li>Allow councils to share best practice examples, as it is easy to see which plans have scored the highest in various sections.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We also hope that these scorecards highlight just how hard some councils are working despite lack of support from the national government, as well as encouraging councils who are not performing as well to take more action by seeing what is possible.</p>

                <p>In this pilot project we have only marked Council Climate Action Plans. These scorecards do not take into account the actual action being taken by council: in future years we intend to do so.</p>
                <p>However, this preparatory work is vital as a strong plan is essential to taking robust climate action over a sustained period of time. Without a plan it is impossible for residents to participate in the democratic process of holding their councils to account.</p>
